This project aims to make basketball analytics more accessible by empowering non-technical users to interact with complex NBA datasets using natural language. By fine-tuning an open-source LLM to translate English questions into accurate SQL queries, the system provides fact-based, grounded insights without requiring SQL knowledge.

## Project Highlights

- **Custom Dataset Pipeline**: Developed an orchestration workflow to clean, augment, and synthesize Text-to-SQL query pairs, enhancing model generalization and fine-tuning quality. 
- **Data Preprocessing**: Leveraged FAISS-based semantic retrieval to enrich queries and used Unsloth for efficient tokenization and LoRA-based fine-tuning. 
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Benchmarked against multiple models including N-Gram, Seq2Seq LSTM, and pre-trained Mistral and LLaMA.
- **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuned a LLaMA 3.2B-Instruct model using a domain-specific NBA dataset via Unsloth, applying 5-bit quantization for GPU efficiency. 
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessed output quality using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, BLEU, and BERTScore to capture syntactic and semantic fidelity.
- **Chatbot Interface**: Implemented a Streamlit + LangChain-based chatbot to allow intuitive natural language interaction with the NBA database.
- **Local Deployment**: Deployed the quantized LLM locally using Ollama, with public access enabled through Ngrok for easy testing and demonstrations.
