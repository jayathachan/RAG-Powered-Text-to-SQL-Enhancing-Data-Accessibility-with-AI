DO NOT include any extra text, explanations, or commentary outside the JSON object. The JSON must begin with "{" and end with "}" and nothing else.

  "sql": "<The SQL query>"
}

REMEMBER: DO NOT YAP. DO NOT PROVIDE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE JSON.
In case of names like team name or Player name please use the exact case. If player name is aKsHAY then exactly use name = 'aKsHAY'
